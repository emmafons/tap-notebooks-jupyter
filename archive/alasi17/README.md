## ALASI2017 Text Analytics Workshop - UQ - 30 Nov 2017

This notebook was developed for a workshop run by Antonette Shibani, Sophie Abel, and [Andrew Gibson](https://github.com/andrewresearch) at ALASI 2017.

The code is written in Python 3. The easiest way to run the notebook is using the Jupyter `all-spark-notebook` docker image:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 jupyter/all-spark-notebook
```

The notebook requires access to a running version of [TAP](https://github.com/uts-cic/tap).
