    "In this workshop, we demonstrate how Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies can be used to help us computationally process large scale of textual data, and we examine how these kinds of technologies can play a positive role in learning contexts.The entire session will be hands-on, interacting with a text analytics system via this Jupyter notebook which runs in Python. \n",

    "### The Writing Analytics Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Using some basic writing analytics, *this notebook demonstrates the process through which pedagogy and analytics come together* in order to provide formative feedback to students on their writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key elements of the process are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A clearly defined learning task\n",
    "- An understanding of the students response to the task (the writing)\n",
    "- One or more hypotheses on how aspects of the learning task may be related to computationally identifiable features in the student writing\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the process, the aim is to balance what is possible with the technology (i.e. Natural Language Processing - NLP) with what is valuable in terms of student learning. This is illustrated in the following diagram:\n",
