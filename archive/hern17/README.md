## HERN Symposium Workshop - QUT - 27 Nov 2017

This notebook was developed for a workshop run by [Andrew Gibson](@andrewresearch) at the 2017 Higher Education Research Network (HERN) Symposium at [Queensland University of Technology (QUT)](http://www.qut.edu.au).

The code is written in Scala and uses the Apache Toree kernel. The easiest way to run the notebook is using the Jupyter `all-spark-notebook` docker image:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 jupyter/all-spark-notebook
```

The notebook requires access to a running version of [TAP](https://github.com/uts-cic/tap).
