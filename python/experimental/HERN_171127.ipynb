    "## Reflecting, writing, and analytics: What can we learn from student text as data?\n",
    "### HERN Workshop - 27 Nov 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "What does a studentsâ€™ language say about their learning? When they put their personal thoughts into words, what does it reveal about them, their thinking, and their interactions with others? In this workshop we will explore some of the ways reflective writing can be used for learning, and take an introductory look at how we can discover meaningful aspects of the writing through computational analysis. During the workshop, we will experiment with a couple of tools for analysing writing, examine some cases of how these tools were used for learning, and we will establish some important principles for using writing analytics in a learning and teaching context."
